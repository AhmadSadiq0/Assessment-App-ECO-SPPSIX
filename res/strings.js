export const ECO_TEXT = `On this Early Childhood Outcomes (ECO) Summary Form, complete the Child's Information first.\n
Then, indicate the team of people involved in the decision of summary ratings. Remember, the team should include people who have experience with the child and the child's functioning across a variety of settings and situations. The team could include but is not limited to: parents, teachers, child-care providers, therapists, and case managers.\n
To complete the ratings for the three ECO Areas-- Positive Social Relationships, Acquire and Use Knowledge and Skills, and Take Appropriate Action to Meet Own Needs-- the team completes the Summary of Evidence, which provides information on the types of evidence used to support the overall rating. If there are Special Considerations, like assistive technology or accommodations available in everyday (or occasional) environments, include that information, and be sure your Summary of Evidence responses reflect those considerations.\n
Then after reviewing the evidence it is time to do the ratings for each ECO Area. The purpose of these ratings is to get an overall picture of how the child currently typically functions with the variety of people and across settings in his/her life. (Definitions for the ratings are provided in the Main Menu for download). For each of the three Area summaries, the team needs to decide the extent to which the child displays functioning expected for his or her age, related to each outcome area. Answers should reflect the childâ€™s actual functioning across a range of settings, not his/her capacity to function under ideal circumstances.\n
After you have completed out the Child Outcomes Summary Form, click on the Submit button at the bottom of this page.`
